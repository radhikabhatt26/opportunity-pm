The Opportunity Project uses federal data to catalyze the creation of new digital tools that increase American economic opportunity. By facilitating collaboration between tech companies, government agencies, and local communities, we are transform data into digital tools that meet local needs. Tools created through the Opportunity Project have helped military spouses find jobs that match their skills, unemployed Americans find housing near job opportunities and local leaders to use data to better target their investments.

The Opportunity Project Team created this playbook as a guide for anyone who wants to use our process, which may include teachers hoping to acquaint their students with government data, local governments who want their data to be put to use to address the needs of residents, and community groups looking to partner with tech talent to advance their missions.

The Opportunity Project process is not one size fits all and will look different depending on who you are and what big challenges you want to solve. The steps below reflect lessons weâ€™ve learned, but you should adapt it to your needs, and share back with us what did or did not worked for you.
