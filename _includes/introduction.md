[The Opportunity Project](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/07/fact-sheet-white-house-launches-opportunity-project-utilizing-open-data) is catalyzing the creation of new digital tools that use federal and local data to empower communities with information about critical resources, such as affordable housing, quality schools, and jobs. By providing easy access to curated federal and local datasets at [opportunity.census.gov](http://opportunity.census.gov), and facilitating collaboration between technologists, issue experts, and community leaders, the Opportunity Project is transforming government data into digital tools that help meet needs in communities like finding affordable housing near jobs and transportation, advocating for broader access to opportunity in neighborhoods, and making data-driven investments to increase economic mobility.

We created a playbook as a guide for anyone who wants to use the Opportunity Project process: teachers who want their students to learn how to use government data to help solve local and national challenges, federal agencies with priorities that would benefit from new digital tools for the public, local governments who want their data to be put to use to address the needs of local residents, community groups looking to partner with tech talent to build capacity to meet their missions, and more!
