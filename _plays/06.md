title: Share your tool with the world
---

Make a splash when you release your tool! The Opportunity Project team has historically launched multiple tools at once, through coordinated events that incorporate in-person, online, and social media channels. Hopefully you have been working closely with end-users and advocacy groups that represent them throughout your build process, so those members of your team can help to adopt the tool and share it with others through their various marketing and outreach platforms. For example, if you worked to build a tool that serves veterans, the best place to make sure your tool is shared would be through veteran services providers themselves, either at a launch at their organization or through their online presence.

### Checklist
- Consider whether to host an event to showcase your tools.
-	Use press and social media to spread the word! Use #OpportunityProject.
-	Be sure to incorporate end-users and their advocates in the launch process to ensure adoption.
- Share your code! Teams are highly encouraged to make all resulting software and tools open source and free for use by the public.
