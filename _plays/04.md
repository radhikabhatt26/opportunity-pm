title: Find the data
---

The Opportunity Project believes that by working together and combining different types of public data, we can expand access to economic opportunity. To help you use this information, we pulled together some of the best federal and local open data sets for information on local access to opportunity, things like proximity to jobs, transportation, affordable housing and quality schools.


### Checklist
- Start by checking out Opportunity Project tagged data sets on data.gov/opportunity. Browse the data, and download a metadata file with info on the year, format, and a brief, plain-language description of what’s in each data set.  
- Identify the most relevant federal and local data sets that can help to address your target end user’s needs, as identified in your use case(s). This activity can be greatly facilitated by a collaborator or "data steward" from a US government agency who can describe data sets in detail and answer relevant questions. Understanding things like a data set's granularity in terms of location or frequency may prove invaluable for your build effort. For example, if you want to build a tool that helps individuals search for jobs, you may want to avoid a data set with only national or state-level data that is will unlikely to be sufficient for users at the local level.
- Pro tip for techies: Cut down on data discovery time by using existing tools, wrappers, and tutorials.  Check out the list provided in the resources list below.
Have questions or feedback about the data? Let us know on [GitHub](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/opportunity).

### Data resources
-	[Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/): Data.gov has over 200,000 data sets from federal government agencies.  You can specifically filter on  Opportunity Project data sets by filtering in the side navigating under "tags" and choosing "opportunity project."
- You can also ask the Opportunity Project community on Slack or GitHub with help for direction on data sets. Stack overflow is also a great tool where many members of the public ask questions relevant to federal and local data sets.

### Forums, tutorials, and other tools
- [data.world](https://data.world/opportunity?tab=datasets): Data.world hosts a compilation of data sets from the Opportunity Project and provides a space to share feedback on data and collaborate with others using the data.  This makes it easy for educators, data scientists, everyday citizens, and students, to discuss, analyze, query, visualize, and easily share their findings. You should go here if you want to share feedback or see what others have said about/done with the data.  You can also find exercises for students based on the Opportunity Project problem statements and datasets including this exercise on [Data Wrangling](https://data.world/nrippner/opportunity-project-use-case) and [Cluster Analysis](https://data.world/nrippner/cluster-analysis-challenge).
- [CitySDK](https://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/examples/arcGisHUD/): The Census Bureau created a series of tools that make it easier to combine and use government data. You can find an Opportunity Project module on the CitySDK website.
- [Commerce Data Usability Project](https://www.commerce.gov/datausability/): The Commerce Data Service has built a number of wrappers and [tutorials](http://blog.kaggle.com/category/tutorials/) that make Commerce datasets including our national weather data, Census data, patent data, and others, more easy to use.
-	[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/commerce-gov) is a community of 600K data scientists that has posted a number of USG datasets and also great tutorials for new data scientists. Stack Exchange has a [vibrant open data community](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/), which is a great place to come with questions and find early answers to your data- and developer-related questions.
