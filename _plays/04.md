title: Find the data
---

We believe that by working together and combining different types of public data, we can build more equitable communities and expand access to opportunity for all. These public government data sets belong to all of us, and together we can use them to help solve any problem.  To help you use this information, we pulled together some of the best federal and local open data sets for information on local access to opportunity, things like proximity to jobs, transportation, affordable housing and quality schools

### Checklist
1. Start by checking out the Opportunity Project [data dictionary](http://opportunity.census.gov/build.html#datainventory). Browse the data, and download a metadata file with info on the year, format, and a brief plain language description of what’s in each data set. This file has short, easy to read descriptions of federal and local data sets. 
2. Identify the most relevant federal and local data sets that can help to address your target end user’s needs, as identified in your use case(s).  
3. Have questions or feedback about the data? Let us know on [GitHub](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/opportunity).
