title: Build iteratively and collaboratively
---

Once you identify a problem to tackle, the end users your tool will serve, and the data you will use, start building and sharing your experience with the TOP community! Work collaboratively on a software development sprint. Include many voices and perspectives in the process (government, experts, people with lived experience, technologists, and community leaders), and seek feedback as much as possible throughout, especially from people who are the target end users of what you’re building. For example, the Opportunity Project started with an 8-week software development sprint. Tech developers, experts, community leaders, people from federal and local government and others came together, chose problems to work on, and formed teams.  These groups talked regularly on Slack, and all came together in web hangouts every 2 weeks to demo their works in progress, ask questions, and share feedback. After 8 weeks, they all launched their products together at the White House and continued to improve them and share them with the target end users.

### Checklist
1. Before you start, think about how you will track success and the reach of your tool, such as tracking downloads or visitors, and learning more from users about how the product is influencing what they do and how. 
2. Identify the path for adoption once the tool is released – how will you connect end users with your product?  
3. Engage target end users, advocates, and subject matter experts early and often in the design process. Collect feedback through user testing sessions or design demos.

### Timeline, week-by-week

1. Before kickoff: Identify a cohort of technologists, government, subject matter experts, and community groups. Create a listserv and/or slack channel for them. 
1. Week 1: Teams choose problem statements 
1. Week 2: Teams dig into the data and start designing and building
1. Week 3: Alpha demo of the tools in progress so teams can get feedback from a diverse audience of end users, subject matter experts, government employees, and others
1. Week 4: Teams continue building while collaborating and getting more feedback along the way
1. Week 5: Do another demo! Teams share more advanced versions of the tools and get more feedback. 
1. Week 6: Teams keep building, doing interactive user testing sessions, and refining the tool. 
1. Week 7:  Get ready to share the tools with the world. De-bug. Plan how to share the final products. 
1. Week 8:  Everyone involved in the process joins together to launch the prototypes or final products.
1. Week 9 and beyond: Continued improvement of the tools, getting the word out, sharing the product with the target end users, and measuring your impact. 

### Resources
- Identify subject matter experts and other collaborators on Slack.
- Software developers can also use Slack or in GitHub to share code, ask questions, post new suggested data sets, share feedback on data, and more.
