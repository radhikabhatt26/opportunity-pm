title: Choose a Problem Statement
---

The Opportunity Project is about solving real-world problems facing individuals and communities. While using data is part of this, it is critical that you identify the social problem you want to solve, and the data you believe can solve it second.


### Checklist

- To identify a meaningful challenge, you might want to connect with community groups, local leaders, federal agencies or non-profits who are mission-driven and close to challenges on the ground.
- Make sure to choose a challenge where a new digital tool that uses [federal and local data](http://opportunity.census.gov/build.html#datainventory) would be helpful.
- Ask yourself whether it is realistic for you to develop something that could have a meaningful impact on this problem.
- Consult with stakeholders and future users of your tool before you build anything. This is critical step in building a useful tool, but one that is easy to overlook. Don’t skip it!

### Resources
- [Challenges articulated by federal agencies](https://data.world/opportunity/problem-statements) to address national priorities. We want teams to continue identifying creative new approaches to address these challenges in communities around the country.
-	Detailed [user-scenarios ](http://opportunity.census.gov/build.html#userscenarios)offered through the Opportunity Project that can help you identify real-world challenges that affect people’s lives.
