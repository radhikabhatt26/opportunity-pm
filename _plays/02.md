title: Team up
---

Collaboration is an essential part of the Opportunity Project process! You can team up with others before or after identifying a problem statement to be sure you have all the skills and perspectives you need to build a useful, high quality digital tool. Your goal is to recruit a team of people to work together, which might include technologists, government leaders, subject matter experts, and end-users, and think about other ways to add diversity to your team.

### Checklist
- Connect with a diverse set of collaborators with the knowledge and skills to create a user-centered tool with a path to adoption. This might include data experts, techies, designers, community leaders, and people who are the target users of the tool.  
- Make sure these partners include people who work directly on issues related to your challenge and ideally people experiencing the problem directly, or people who work closely with them. 
- Universities can be a great place to start since they are full of people with a wide variety of skills and perspectives, including community and policy subject matter experts and technologists.
- Include people who are trained in user-centered design and user experience. 
- Who will maintain it once it’s built? Who will make sure it gets in the hands of end-users? Do you have the right partners at the table for that? 

### Resources
- If you’re looking for additional tech talent, you can also go to your local tech Meetups or [Code for America Brigade](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/brigade/list) if there is one in your community.  
- Join our online Slack community to recruit collaborators and chat with others. Start a conversation by location, issue, or anything else!
