Your tool's launch is just the beginning!Â  Get the word out and make sure people are using the tool you built.  

### Checklist
- Keep building and improving.
-	Remember that agile delivery relies on iterative improvements. Technical team members should be ready and willing to maintain and improve whatever tool is in production, otherwise your early efforts may have been for naught!
-	Collect information on unique page views and users through Google Analytics, and think about measuring outcomes and how your tool is helping individuals and communities.  What impact are you having on the problem you set out to solve?  
-	Share information with the whole Opportunity Project community on Slack.
