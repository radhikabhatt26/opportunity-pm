title: Co-create the vision
---

Work with your team to identify user needs and align on a use case that focuses who you are targeting. The Opportunity Project promotes  co-creation by working directly with end users of the tool, so that you’re building *with* them, and not just *for* them. The problems you’re working on to make communities more equitable are complex, and no one person has all the answers. Working together with a diverse team will help you to build a product of ultimate value.

### Checklist
- Work with community leaders and end-users to understand the challenge and the gaps that you might help fill. Answer questions such as: How do people experience the problem? Do they have any tools to help them currently? What are the gaps that exist in their current tools? What tools do users they wish they had?
-	Create a detailed [use-case] (http://www.gatherspace.com/static/use_case_example.html) to guide your efforts.
-	Remember the words of Jakob Nielsen: "One of usability’s most hard-earned lessons is that ‘you are not the user.’ If you work on a development project, you’re atypical by definition. Design to optimize the user experience for outsiders, not insiders."

### Resources
- Use the [user-scenarios](http://opportunity.census.gov/build.html#userscenarios) on our site as a starting point – these scenarios provide a detailed snapshot of some important problems that have already been defined.
-	Watch this [user-centered design training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR0u_Y7d63E) that Exygy created for Opportunity Project participants.
